### EXPERIENCE 

##### UEPL | Karachi | Pakistan

**Reservoir Geophysicist I | APR 2018 – DEC 2019**

**Reservoir Geophysicist II | APR 2015 – DEC 2018**

**Reservoir Geophysicist III | APR 2014 – DEC 2015**

**Reservoir Geophysicist IV | APR 2013 – APR 2014**

- Demonstrated proactivity by performing advance analytics on field data to identify top 10 opportunities from 100+ hydrocarbon fields, optimizing across 3 data dimensions. Presented to higher management where the resulting opportunities became the basis of planning for the year 2019 
- Took lead on executing attribute analysis on 8-dimensional data to predict subsurface properties and reduced uncertainty in future opportunities saving ~$1.5 million in the well’s cost along with added oil production profits
- Regularly employed regression analysis for time to depth conversion of 3D seismic data to predict reservoir depth along with supervised and unsupervised classification for sub-surface pattern detection
- Performed ETL on raw wireline logs data to standardize and normalize data across multiple sources, remove noise along with correlation and estimation of missing parameters across all dimensions
- Demonstrated statistical understanding by employing statistical methods to estimate hydrocarbon in-place numbers using GEOX statistical volumes calculation software and Oracle Crystal ball plugin 
- Exhibit understanding of time series analysis by using it on VSP data to predict unknown properties of a planned well in a new location 
- Took initiative to collaborate and obtain new well approval from six cross functional teams to reduce cost of project by removing excess pipelines
- Performed risk assessment through uncertainty reduction to predict chance of success for new wells
- Used cross plots & regional correlations to evaluate well contact information
- Responsible for regular joint venture and technical asset evaluation communication with stakeholders
- Demonstrated attention to detail and responsibility by ensuring all regulatory reports for my projects were created and filed on time
