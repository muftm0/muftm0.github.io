#### EXPERIENCE 

**Reservoir Geophysicist  |  UEPL**

APR 2013 – DEC 2019, KARACHI, PAK
●	Performed data analysis data from 100+ oil fields to identify top 10 opportunities for optimization across 3 different data dimensions which best reflected production optimization opportunities 
●	Regularly employed regression analysis for time to depth conversion of 3D seismic data to predict reservoir depth
●	Performed ETL on wireline logs data to standardize and normalize data across multiple sources, remove noise along with correlation and estimation of missing parameters across all dimensions
●	Executed attribute analysis on multidimensional data to predict subsurface properties for reducing uncertainty in future opportunities.
●	Performed risk assessment through uncertainty reduction to predict chance of success for new wells
●	Used cross plots & regional correlations to evaluate well contact information
●	Carried out Static modeling using geostatistical analysis by employing variograms for property modeling
●	Used statistical methods to estimate hydrocarbon in-place numbers  using GEOX statistical volumes calculation software and Oracle Crystal ball probabilistic & deterministic distribution software
●	Actively involved in creation and filing of regulatory reports
●	Responsible for regular inter departmental communication and stakeholder management
