### EXPERIENCE 

##### UEPL | Karachi | Pakistan
** Reservoir Geophysicist I | APR 2018 – DEC 2019
Reservoir Geophysicist II | APR 2015 – DEC 2018
Reservoir Geophysicist III | APR 2014 – DEC 2015
Reservoir Geophysicist IV | APR 2013 – APR 2014**

 - Took lead on executing attribute analysis on multidimensional data to predict subsurface properties and reduced uncertainty in future opportunities saving ~$1.5 million in the well’s cost along with added oil production profits.
- Showed initiative and out of the box thinking by performing field data analysis to identify top 10 opportunities from 100+ hydrocarbon fields, optimizing across 3 data dimensions. The resulting opportunities were the basis of planning for the year 2019.
- Reduced domain conversion errors by employing regression analysis for time to depth conversion of 3D seismic data to predict reservoir depth within an error range of +/- 5%.
 - Performed ETL on wireline logs data to standardize and normalize data across multiple sources, remove noise along with correlation and estimation of missing parameters across all dimensions
- Demonstrated attention to detail and responsibility by ensuring all regulatory reports for my projects were created and filed on time.
