I am a passionate Data Scientist with a background in petroleum industry working as a geoscientist. As a child I was an avid puzzle solver which helped me sharpen critical thinking, problem solving and pattern detection skills â€“ imperative for success in both fields

I discovered my interest in data science performing post-mortem on an inherited failed well. Scrutinizing the data through ML and Data Analytics, I led my team to an alternate well that saved my company 1.5 million dollar. 

I am ecstatic to work as a Data Scientist and use my analytical work experience, newly acquired Machine Learning skills and passion for problem solving to come up with natural, simple, and valuable outcomes of complex and uncertain real-world problems.
