### Background and Motivation Behind Career Evolution

Before we begin, a disclaimer – the views expressed in my article are solely my own and are derived from my internal values. You do not have to feel the same way or even agree with me, but I do hope that you are respectful and accepting. 

In the past few days, several petroleum industry professionals have reached out to me, curious about my career evolution. So, for the interest of those who have contacted me or those who want to contact me and are a little hesitant (I understand, sometimes we don’t even know what to ask or where to begin from), here I am writing about my thought process, journey and learnings.
